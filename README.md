org.eclipse.cdt.embsysregview
=============================
This is a personal work clone of the great EmbSysRegView project.
The official page of the project is at [SourceForge](http://embsysregview.sourceforge.net/).

This exists mainly so I can try out some UI improvements and new features.
I'm not sure about the maintenance status of the official project, I've [posted a patch](https://sourceforge.net/p/embsysregview/discussion/964553/thread/5b1f63c9/) but so far had little response.
At the time this was first published (mid-September 2016) it's been more than a month without any response to that patch.

Here's how EmbSysRegView looked before my changes:

and here's how it looks with my changes:

The new buttons in the top-left corner are:

- Collapse all
- Activate all
- Copy active registers to clipboard
